1. all files are in the following repo - https://github.com/ketanp05/problem-solving.git

2. study lambda functions in cpp

3. we cannot declare a variable and store the address of another variable in it

4. It’s considered a best practice to set a pointer to nullptr when it is declared, unless it is initialized to some valid address

5. deallocate memory: you can delete the allocated memory but the not the ptr variable declared

6. the compilers can directly generate default constructors for us
Account() = default; // this becomes our default constructor
Account(double balance){this->balance = balance;} // parametrized constructor

7. Request and Suppress in CPP

8. override and final in cpp

9. Definition of a function in a derived class hides all overloads of the same function in the base class

10. Because we can’t make an object of pure virtual class. It will give an error
